## Validation Rules

The generator validates your configuration:

1. **Required fields**: All required fields must be present and non-empty
2. **Email format**: If provided, email must be valid (e.g., `user@domain.com`)
3. **Project type**: Must be one of: `proposal`, `major-project`, `presentation`
4. **Logo path**: If specified, file must exist
5. **Font size**: Must be 10, 11, or 12
6. **Line spacing**: Must be 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0

## Tips

1. **Use quotes**: Always quote string values in YAML to avoid parsing issues
2. **Leave empty for optional**: Use `""` or omit the field entirely for optional fields
3. **Comments**: Use `#` for comments in your config file
4. **Validation**: Run the generator to validate your config before editing templates
5. **Reusability**: Save your config file for future use or sharing with peers
