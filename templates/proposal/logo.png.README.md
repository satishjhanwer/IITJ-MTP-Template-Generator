# Logo Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the university logo.

## Using a Custom Logo

To use your university's logo:

1. Replace `logo.png` with your university's logo file
2. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, PDF
3. Recommended size: 300x300 pixels minimum
4. The logo will be displayed on the title page

## Creating a Placeholder

If you don't have a logo yet, you can:
- Use a simple university seal or emblem
- Create a text-based logo with your university name
- Leave this placeholder until you obtain the official logo

## Note

The template references `logo.png` in the title page. Make sure your logo file is named correctly or update the reference in `titlePage.tex`.
